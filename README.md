# Physics-Conditioned Diffusion Models for Lattice Gauge Field Theory

It's a note book for demonstrating how the Diffusiom Models can be applied into the U(1) Gauge theory.

## Getting Started

    The code requires Python >= 3.8 and PyTorch >= 2.0.

You can configure on CPU machine and accelerate with a recent Nvidia GPU card(recommended).

The [notebook](DMasSQ_U(1).ipynb) is self-contained and can be run on your local machine. But one can also run it on Google Colab.
